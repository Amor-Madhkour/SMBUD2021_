These guidelines describe how to import the dashboard after the vaccinations index has been created.

From Kibana, go to Stack Management->Saved Objects
Click on import and select the file dashboard.ndjson
Import it.

Kibana will override the index pattern with the one saved along the dashboard.
It's the default one and should work properly, 
but if there are problems you can check "request action on conflict" and do not override it when prompted

If the dashboard can't be imported or shown properly,
you can import the file visualizations.ndjson following the same procedure of above.
It will add the single visualizations to your library.
You can create a new dashboard and add them: the layout, controls and texts of out dashboard aren't really important
